The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat

THE DOLPHINS and Whales waged a fierce war with each other. When the
battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the waves and
said that he would reconcile their differences if they would accept
him as an umpire. One of the Dolphins replied, “We would far rather be
destroyed in our battle with each other than admit any interference from
you in our affairs.”
